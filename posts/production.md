## Production

Anything that is used by someone other than the developers of the thing, is production.
Your disaster recovery environment isn't production until someone is using it.
Your development environment becomes production when you let another team use it.
A development environment is any environment that is only being used by the developers.
Other names conflate and confuse how applications work together.

If you want to spin up a test instance via a cloud provider, you do not use their test environment.
You do not have access to their testing environments, because they are not yours.
If you did have access to such environments, they would be production environments.
The level of support of production environments can differ wildly.
