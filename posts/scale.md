## Scale

The vast majority of things I hear about scale are wild speculation, usually pre-mature optimization.
There is zero value in trying to build something of scale without any current customers.
You should consider the architecture, but do not consider suspected growth.
Start by making a few customers happy, then worry about making more happy.
You first need to have something worth scaling.
