## Control and Responsibility

When looking situations that I find frustrating, I increasingly find discrepancies between control and responsibility.
There are several ways in which these can be mismatched:
- Control gap: nobody has control
- Responsibility gap: nobody is responsible
- Control overlap: toe stepping, overruling, etc.
- Responsibility overlap: finger pointing, blame
- Control without Responsibility: no skin in the game, low incentive/motivation
- Responsibility without control: anxiety, micromanagement, blame

When we have both control and responsibility for something, we are empowered to take action.
When we have responsibility but no control, we feel helpless and need others who have the control.
When we have control but no responsibility, we take shortcuts and lack motivation to move forward.
With alignment, you can take action on the things you care about.
Without alignment, you care about something you can't take action on or can take action on things you don't care about.

As a mental exercise, imagine the set of all things that you are responsible for.
Then, as independently as possible, imagine the set of all things you can change without other teams?
How close are those two sets to being the same?
