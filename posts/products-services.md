## Products and Services

Products and services are one way decompose an organization.
There are several key aspects to making this decomposition work
- Product/service [teams](./teams.md) are full stack: they are solely responsible for delivery.
- The requestor of the product/service is the same as the person that receives the product/service.
- Dependencies of the product/service are also product services.

Without full stack ownership, you have misalignment with [control and responsibilty](./control-responsibility.md).
If the request/receiver are not the same, then you do not have a [recursive structure](./recursive-structures.md).
If dependencies are not product/services, they are much more difficult and slow to consume effectively.
