## Experimentation

Experimentation is a learning focused style of working.
The general idea is to try to answer specific questions as quickly as possible in an exploratory context.
When you find an answer or solution, you then take the learning and integrate it into the greater product/service.
I have found that many experiments can be done more quickly that hypothetical conversations.
This is one of the reasons that I am biased towards action.

Experimentation encourages multiple approaches.
Anecdotally, if you try more than one approach, you think of even more approaches/questions.
This exploration results in more ideas and the final agreed upon solution is often not one of the first ideas.
Through intention exploration of multiple approaches, I find more elegant and sustainable solutions.
