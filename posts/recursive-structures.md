## Recursive Structures

Recursive structures are things that are composed of smaller parts that have the same structure as the whole.
These show up everywhere, here are some examples:
- Branches of trees, have branches of branches.
- Pipeline are made of smaller pipelines connected together.
- Software packages are made of many packages together with some custom code.
- Most large organizations hierarchies, my boss' boss' boss.
- Functions calling functions that call functions.

These days, it's hard for me not to see these structures everywhere. 
When I'm thinking about value-streams, how teams are structured, or actually coding I can't help but be drawn to the structure.
Here are some interesting properties of recursive structures:
- They can scale exponentially.
- Understanding the base structure provides understanding of the whole structure.
- The boundary/interface of the structure matches with itself.
- You can look at any size of collection of parts and the structure is still the same.
