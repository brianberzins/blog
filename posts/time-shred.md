## Time Shred

Time Shred is a term I have been using to describe splitting time between multiple efforts.
The term is intentionally negative/aggressive sounding.
Some indicators that you have time shred:
- Meetings interrupt your flow of work.
- You have multiple things in progress at the same time.
- You are supposed to dedicate some of your time to different projects.
- You have work that is currently blocked.
