## Time Shred

Time Shred is a term I have been using to describe splitting time between multiple efforts.
The term is intentionally negative/aggressive sounding.
Some indicators that you have time shred:
- Meetings interrupt your flow of work.
- You have multiple things in progress at the same time.
- You are supposed to dedicate some of your time to different projects.
- You have work that is currently blocked.

The opposite of time shred is dedicated time directly working on a single priority item.
Note that having zero time shred is not possible, people need sleep, food, breaks, etc.
The more time shred you have, the less you are capable of getting things done.
More work in progress, means delays in getting priority items to completion.
More interruptions and context switches means less time getting priority items done.
