## Test Driven Development

A lot of discussion around test driven development (TDD) is just talking about "test first".
Writing test code first is a part of what makes TDD work.
The red/green/refactor loop is a solid foundation, but I think the major benefit comes from design.
Write the tests the way you want the code to work based on your current knowledge.
Then it isn't just about making the test pass, it's about making that specific test pass.
The test drives which methods you need to implement, and what information you need to have/pass.
The result will be elegant code that works, that is easily testable by design.

Non-exhaustive list of benefits:
- New code is fully tested
- Tests are simple and easy to follow by design
- Breaks down work into small steps
- Drastic reduction in number of bugs
- Rapid delivery of small features
- Confidence that the code works as expected
- Tests are codified documentation of desired behavior
- Code mirrors the simplicity of the tests
