## Blamelessness

Blame is symptom is a much greater problem.
It frequently results from a separation of [control and responsibility](./control-responsibility.md).

If you see blame happening, make a note of it, preferably in a postmortem.
Collect the facts of the situation, build out a timeline of the events.
Without judgement, ask people why they took the actions that they did.
Identify what can be done to help people take actions that we think would have been better.

Blame isn't just something to avoid because we can use it as a guide to deeper problems.
The goal is not to solve blame, but instead to remove the conditions that result in blame in the first place.
