## Teams

What even is a team?
I asked a bunch of people is a relatively small coaching community and got wildly different answers. 
These are people that I suspected would have similar views on what makes a team.
For me, the loosest definition of team is "A set of people, working together, towards a shared goal".
This definition is narrow to the point of being meaningless.

Here's a list of some things that I think are necessary for healthy teams:
- Enough people to cover for two people being unavailable at the same time.
- Equal permissions, so that everyone can do everything the team needs to do.
- Alignment of control and responsibility. 
- Ability to experiment, learn, and grown.
- Dedicated individuals.
- Treated like a single unit, rather than as a collection of individuals.

Within organizations, teams can be [recursive structures](./recursive-structures.md).
In order for this structure to work, the interaction between teams need to operate the same way at all levels.
An example is if each team is responsible for a [product or service](./products-services.md).
Note that these structures are generally very flat, and do not consist of many layers of management.
The layering of such teams comes from products/services being built on top of other products and services.
