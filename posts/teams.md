## Teams

What even is a team?
I asked a bunch of people is a relatively small coaching community and got wildly different answers. 
These are people that I suspected would have similar views on what makes a team.
For me, the loosest definition of team is "A set of people, working together, towards a shared goal".
This definition is narrow to the point of being meaningless.

Here's a list of some things that I think are necessary for healthy teams:
- Enough people to cover for two people being unavailable at the same time.
- Equal permissions, so that everyone can do everything the team needs to do.
- Alignment of control and responsibility. 
- Ability to experiment, learn, and grown.
- Dedicated individuals.
- Treated like a single unit, rather than as a collection of individuals.

Within organizations, teams can be [recursive structures](./recursive-structures.md).
In order for this structure to work, the interaction between teams need to operate the same way at all levels.
An example is if each team is responsible for a [product or service](./products-services.md).
Note that these structures are generally very flat, and do not consist of many layers of management.
The layering of such teams comes from products/services being built on top of other products and services.

Does your team have matching [control and responsibility](./control-responsibility.md)?
This is something that I see many teams struggle with because it requires action from outside the team.
If the team has control to make control and responsibility align, then they can self correct.
If the team doesn't have that control, then that control is outside the team.
Interestingly, I have rarely seen a manager in a position to change this either.
This is probably because to make changes to a team, you actually need to change multiple teams.
Such obstacles make it difficult to organize teams effectively.
