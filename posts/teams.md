## Teams

What even is a team?
I asked a bunch of people is a relatively small coaching community and got wildly different answers. 
These are people that I suspected would have similar views on what makes a team.
For me, the loosest definition of team is "A set of people, working together, towards a shared goal".
This definition is narrow to the point of being meaningless.

Here's a list of some things that I think are necessary for healthy teams:
- Enough people to cover for two people being unavailable at the same time.
- Equal permissions, so that everyone can do everything the team needs to do.
- Alignment of control and responsibility. 
- Ability to experiment, learn, and grown.
- Dedicated individuals.
- Treated like a single unit, rather than as a collection of individuals.
