## Mob-programming

Mobbing is a technique used wherein a team works entirely together on the same problem at the same time.
All mobbing utilizes rotations between the person on the keyboard and some form of navigation.
This forces the ideas to be vocalized for everyone as the work is getting done.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of benefits of mobbing:
- Real time code reviews
- Shared context/shared knowledge
- Get the best of everyone combined
- Nobody is ever left behind
- Extremely fast skill up
- Forces all effort onto the highest priority work item
- Rapid identification of technical debt
- Resilient to individual life interruptions (needing to step way, being sick, vacations)
- Reductions in hand-offs
- Reduction in bugs
- Extremely fun

Overall, I have never seen a team that has practiced mob programming for more than a week get less work done than before they mobbed.
There is a learning curve, specifically about social interactions within the mob, that most people eventually grow to like.
